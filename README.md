By analyzing a dataset on game sales alongside critic and user reviews, we aim to assess whether video games have improved over time as the gaming market has expanded. This project will provide an opportunity to investigate the relationship between game sales and reviews, and offer insights into the evolution of the video game industry. | left/inner joins, set theory (union & intersect), subqueries, filtering|

These campaigns were primarily phone-based and often necessitated multiple contacts with the same client to determine their interest in subscribing to a bank term deposit (either 'yes' or 'no'). The main objective of the analysis is to predict the likelihood of clients subscribing to a term deposit, which is represented by the variable 'y' | matplotlib, pandas, seaborn, scikit-learn
