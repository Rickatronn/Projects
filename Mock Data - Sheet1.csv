"Patient Profile: Mr. John DoeDemographic Information: Age: 54 years oldSex: MaleOccupation: High school mathematics teacherMarital Status: Married, two childrenMedical History:John has been managing hypertension for the past 10 years with moderate success, largely through medication and some lifestyle adjustments. He was diagnosed with obesity five years ago. Despite multiple attempts at dieting and exercise, John has struggled to achieve significant weight loss. His father passed away from complications related to type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), which has always been a concern for John. However, until recently, he hadn't experienced any direct symptoms associated with diabetes. Presenting Complaint:John came to the clinic complaining of increased thirst and urination over the last six months. He also noted a weight loss of 15 pounds during the same period, which was unusual given his previous struggles with weight loss. Furthermore, John mentioned experiencing occasional blurred vision, particularly during his evening classes. How John Got Here:John's lifestyle as a high school teacher involves significant stress, which he often copes with by consuming fast food due to time constraints and grading papers late into the night, disrupting his sleep pattern. His exercise is limited to walking around the school campus. The recent shift to remote teaching during the pandemic exacerbated his sedentary lifestyle, as he spent more time seated in front of his computer. Despite the weight loss, which he initially considered a positive development, the accompanying symptoms prompted him to seek medical advice. Social History:John is a dedicated teacher and a loving father. He enjoys reading historical novels and coaching his son's little league baseball team. He has a strong support system, including his wife, who is a nurse, and two teenage children. Despite his busy schedule, he makes time for family dinners most nights of the week, although the meals are not always the healthiest options. John is a social drinker, consuming alcohol occasionally during family gatherings or holidays. Examination and Investigations:Upon examination, John appeared mildly dehydrated with a dry oral mucosa. His BMI was calculated at 31, classifying him as obese. A random blood glucose test showed a glucose level of 300 mg/dL. Follow-up fasting blood tests and an HbA1c test revealed a fasting glucose level of 190 mg/dL and an HbA1c of 9%, confirming the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Blood pressure was recorded at 140/90 mmHg, and his lipid profile was slightly elevated. Diagnosis:Type 2 diabetes mellitus with signs of uncontrolled hyperglycemia. Management Plan:John was counseled on the importance of managing his diabetes through both medication and significant lifestyle changes. A plan was devised to start him on metformin and a SGLT2 inhibitor to control his blood glucose levels. He was also referred to a dietitian for nutritional counseling and a diabetes education program to understand the disease and its management better. John was encouraged to increase his physical activity gradually, starting with daily walks and eventually incorporating more varied exercises into his routine. ICD-10 Code: E11.65 - Type 2 diabetes mellitus with hyperglycemia.
